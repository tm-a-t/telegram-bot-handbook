# Claiming a Username for Your Bot

When you register a bot, you should choose its username carefully. 
It will be difficult to change it afterwards.

When I choose a username, I often want to try different options to find the shortest and prettiest one available.
It is uneasy to do this while actually registering a bot, so I've come up with this hack:
I open my own account settings and type the username I want to try — but not save the changes. 
If the username is taken, a red message will appear. 
This way I quickly try many usernames.

## How should the username look

Bot usernames are no different from usernames of users, groups and channels.
The only constraint is that a username of a bot must end with "bot."

A username can look like this: `@ExampleBot`

There are official bots with special usernames that don't follow the
form: [@pic](https://t.me/pic), [@vid](https://t.me/vid), [@sticker](https://t.me/sticker). Also, you can now buy short
usernames on [Fragment](https://fragment.com/).

## Many usernames are taken

A free username must contain at least 5 characters including "bot."
However, you can't claim such a short username: all usernames of 5 (and maybe 6) characters are taken.

Unfortunately, all these registered bots are mostly dead. Developers rarely support bots for a long time :(

## You can claim a short username through the support

It is possible to change a bot username for free, even if it's claimed by another (inactive) bot.
You will need to contact the support: [@BotSupport](https://t.me/BotSupport). They will check whether your bot works and
supports
English language.

The common format is the following:

```
1. @old_username
2. @new_username
3. Some bot description
```

Then cross your fingers and hope the support won't ignore you. It often does.
