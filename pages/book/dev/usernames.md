# Claiming a Username for Your Bot

When you register a bot, you should choose its username carefully:
it will be difficult to change afterwards.

As I usually try many different usernames to find the shortest and prettiest one available,
I've come up with a hack to check many variants quickly.
Before registering the bot, I open my own account settings and type the username I want to try — but don't save the changes. 
If the username is taken, a red message will appear. 
This is how I check many usernames but not create a bot until I made my choice.

## Username form

Bot usernames are no different from usernames of users, groups and channels.
The only constraint is that a username of a bot must end with "bot."
A username can look like this: `@ExampleBot`

There are some official bots with special usernames that don't follow the
form: [@pic,](https://t.me/pic) [@vid,](https://t.me/vid) [@sticker.](https://t.me/sticker) 
Also, you can now buy short usernames for bots on [Fragment.](https://fragment.com/)

A free username must contain at least 5 characters including "bot."
However, you can't claim such a short username: all usernames of 5 (and maybe 6) characters are taken.
Unfortunately, all these registered bots are mostly dead. Developers rarely support bots for a long time :(

## Claiming a username through support

It is possible to change a bot username for free, even if it's claimed by another (inactive) bot.
You will need to contact the support: [@BotSupport](https://t.me/BotSupport). They will check whether your bot works and
supports
English language.

The common format is the following:

```
1. @old_username
2. @new_username
3. Some bot description
```

Then cross your fingers and hope the support won't ignore you. It often does.
