# Telegram Bots: The Very Basics

As you know, a Telegram bot is a special user account controlled by a server program.
Bots can have dialogs with users, send messages, reply to commands
from users, send pictures, participate in groups and channels, and so on.

However, bots have some limitations compared to real users. 
Most of these limitations are to protect users' privacy:
for instance, bots can't join groups on their own and must be added by users.

Although technically bots are a kind of user account, in this book, I use the term 'users' to refer to people's accounts.

## How to program a bot

Here is a short answer:

1. Register a bot.
2. Choose a library for your favorite programming language.
3. Use the library docs and this book to write the code.

Note that although you can run the bot program on your computer, you will want to use hosting when the code is ready.

All these steps are covered in detail further in the "Development" chapter.
